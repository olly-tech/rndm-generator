# Random Hair Colour Generator
This Python program reads a local text file containing 'votes' for a hair colour and selects one at random.

## Project Description
The program will allow the user to store new hair colour votes in a local file, or read all the options and vote on a hair colour. Ideally, pupil names would be collected with hair colour votes, but as this project may become public, this will be excluded for now.

### Purpose of Generator
While working in a school, I have been giving pupils the chance to vote on my hair colour as I change it regularly. Initially, I would collect votes on paper and pull the result out of a hat, and I realised creating this program would make it easier for me to keep track of all the votes and generate one accordingly.

## Project Plan
- [x] Create Python and text files.
- [x] Menu creation
- [x] Read file function
- [x] Write file function (allow option to add option multiple times for multiple votes)
- [x] Random generator function


### Next Steps and Future Features
- [ ] Create program with better visual UI, such as a website using JS instead of Python.
- [x] Insert information of who voted, create dummy data for public project.
- [ ] Allow user to edit votes.
- [ ] Allow user to see more stats
- [ ] Allow votes to be cleared after colour choice is generated.
